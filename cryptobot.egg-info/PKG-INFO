paper trading, which can easily be configured for realtime trading. 
Just add your api key and secret and the bot is ready to play with the big boys, and will give them a run for their money also.

the internals section is where the bot is supposed to explain to me how it makes his decisions, and evaluates his own performance, so that he can make adjustments to his strategy. Still alot of work to do, but it's getting there
